# Problems running RV-Predict?

We list below some possible issues occurring when using RV-Predict and ways to address them. For any unlisted issue you might experience, please use the [RV Support Center](https://runtimeverification.com/contact#nav-embedded-systems).

## [Error] RV-Predict must be on the PATH for prediction to run

**Problem**  
The above error shows up when running RV-Predict on Windows.
**Reason**  
The Windows version of RV-Predict requires some DLLs (part of the Visual C++ redistributable package) to be on the `PATH` for the prediction process to run.  
**Advice**  
Follow the advice on screen (next line following the error message above) and add the `bin` RV-Predict directory to the `PATH`.

**Problem**  
The above problem persists, although the `bin` directory is on the `PATH`.  
**Reason**  
RV-Predict was installed using a different architecture JVM than the one used for running it.  
**Advice**  
Reinstall RV-Predict using the same JVM you intend to run it with. If you need using RV-Predict with both 32 bit and 64 bit JVMs, try installing it into different locations, using the two JVMs. Note though that you might need different `PATH`s to run each.

## Program does not seem to terminate

**Problem**  
The execution of the program takes too long when run using RV-Predict.  
**Reason**  
It could be due to the overhead required by RV-Predict analysis, or due to a deadlock condition triggered by the logged program.  
**Advice**  
You can stop the program at any time and run the prediction phase on the already logged trace using the `--predict` option with the directory in which the trace was logged (printed by RV-Predict when the logging was started).

## Stack overflow error

**Problem**  
I'm getting an unexpected *Stack Overflow* exception and a huge stack trace when running my program with RV-Predict.  
**Reason**  
The execution trace to be analyzed is collected by RV-Predict using a Java agent, which means that the call stack of the logging module adds on top of the call stack of the original application.  
**Advice**  
Try increasing the stack size of the logged program by passing the `-Xss` (as part of the JVM options) to RV-Predict.
